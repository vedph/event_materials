<p>This strand focuses on the application of digital technologies and a public approach to historical research and dissemination. The classes aim at giving an overview of very different topics, ranging from memory to social media, from television to digital tools, offering reflections on how we connect to, reconstruct, understand and eventually tell our past with digital and public methodologies. The strand includes activities that the students can perform on their own before getting feedback from the teacher. A special attention will be devoted to the intersection between history and the exceptional situation we’re going through due to the Covid-19 emergency.</p>
