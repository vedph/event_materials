<p style="text-align: justify;">This strand focuses on the technological development and its cultural implications which occurred in the arts sector over the last decades. In doing this, the digital aspect is approached both on the side of artistic production and the art system as well as on the side of museums and art historical representation. The issues of technological change, digital nativity, virtual realms and digital tools will be discussed also in the context of the current international situation of crisis. Both the theoretical debate and practical tools for digital art historians shall be explored by means of lectures and labs, which will include a hands-on workshop on tools for digital analysis of illustrations, a students’ forum on digital culture at the time of Covid-19, and a roundtable to discuss recent tools and developments in Digital and Public Art History with experts of European renown.</p>
