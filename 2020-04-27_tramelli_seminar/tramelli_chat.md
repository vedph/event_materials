00:19:04.138,00:19:07.138
JD: Ornamental initials and printer's marks were excluded from the project. What about ornamental frames and cartouches around relevant book illustrations?

GB: For the technically-minded, VISE uses the SIFT algorithm

00:34:08.218,00:34:11.218
GB: Message me for more information on VISE and the work of VGG....

00:38:35.731,00:38:38.731
GB: Wonderful work on matching woodblocks. Note that you need to flip them, and ideally process the images of the block a little. Here are my experiments - http://vgg.gitlab.io/seebibyte-blog/digital-humanities/2017/11/24/Matching-printers-woodblocks-to-their-impressions-with-VISE.html

00:41:56.911,00:41:59.911
JD: At the Plantin-Moretus Museum, we are digitizing and describing the entire collection of 14,000 woodblocks of the Officina Plantiniana. You're welcome to come and study them. And we welcome any kind of cooperation.

00:45:23.280,00:45:26.280
RB: A quick question as I came in late - I saw Paolo Monella's tweets about image similarity searching in this presentation and was wondering if this was using an open source implementation and if so is there a link to the code being used?

00:50:24.372,00:50:27.372
GB: Hi R. - it's not so much similarity search as ImageMatching, and the tool (which is free and open source) is available here - https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vise/. Message me for more details.

00:52:40.698,00:52:43.698
GB: +1 to the idea of transfer learning from the matched blocks. Great idea!

00:55:18.931,00:55:21.931
DM: Itâ€™s a great way to detach the path of collages of woodblocks for the creation of new images

00:55:37.299,00:55:40.299
JD: Short introduction into the woodblock project at the Plantin-Moretus Museum: https://www.faro.be/project/woodblocks-used-scientific-publications-plantin-press

00:56:38.552,00:56:41.552
GB: IIIF in VISE is on the roadmap (https://gitlab.com/vgg/vise/-/commit/cd65b15496d906eec288290f111fbd6017842935) and ought to be supported, at least for ingest, soon. 

00:42:15.855,00:42:18.855
SR: I would like to ask whether you / audience know about a similar project with digitised armorials / heraldic shields. thank you!

00:57:31.005,00:57:34.005
SR: if you can share one.

JD: We have opened up the collection to a wide audience using very basic key words. Using Iconclass is planned for the future, but this will take a lot more time. The basic key words already help us to find specific images that have not yet been properly described with metadata. You can find the collection here: https://www.museumplantinmoretus.be/en/content/impressed-plantin

01:05:04.180,01:05:07.180
GB: https://www.graphikportal.org/ is doing a bit of work on standards for woodblocks, as are various individual institutions and researchers. 

01:05:08.329,01:05:11.329
PB: We are working on icongraphic detection
